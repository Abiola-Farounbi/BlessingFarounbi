            <h6 class="font-bold py-2"> Dear Patron, </h6>
            <h6 class="font-bold py-2"> Introduction </h6>
            

My full name is Blessing Olajumoke Farounbi. I graduated with a CGPA of 4.03/5 in Economics from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria in 2018, completed my Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) professional qualification in 2016 and passed the CFA level 1 examination in December 2018. I am a go-getter, very passionate about making the most of my professional career and making an impact everywhere I go.
In pursuit of my passion to add an international perspective to my knowledge in finance and investment and how technology can be applied to this sector, I applied to the European School of Management and Technology (ESMT), Berlin for a master’s in management degree, with a specialization in finance and investment. After a rigorous and highly competitive application process, I was granted admission to ESMT for the 2020/2021 session with a full tuition scholarship.

<h6 class="font-bold py-2"> Why ESMT Berlin </h6>

ESMT is the no 1. business school in Germany providing specialized courses in Management. My decision to pursue advanced studies at ESMT will not only set me to become an international thought leader in my chosen field, it would also increase my knowledge base and ability to proffer investment solutions in Africa from a global perspective. I am also very passionate about structuring financing options for small and medium enterprises in order to enable them to access the required funds for developing that innovative idea or achieve scale in their production process or service offerings.  

<h6 class="font-bold py-2"> My Predicament </h6>

My admission to ESMT Berlin was also attached to a full tuition scholarship based on my intellectual excellence as well as evidence of personal, academic and professional achievement. The full tuition scholarship granted by the ESMT covers my tuition and cases only. The total cost for living expenses for the two year program total €20,000, this is equivalent to NGN10,000,000.

However, my current focus is on the amount required by the German consulate in Lagos to process my student visa in order for me to commence my studies in Germany. This amount is approximately €10,500 , equivalent to NGN5,118,000. So far, from all my savings and the kind contributions from family and friends. I have been able to raise a total sum of €4500 with a balance of €6000 Euros i.e. NGN3,000,000 currently outstanding.

Due to Covid-19, ESMT had come up with an online Management Essential Program with other schools like IE, Spain and Imperial College, London to provide an online learning platform for students that would be unable to make it to Campus in time for the earlier resumption date of 15th September. With this, I have been able to buy some time to raise the required funds and finalize my visa application with the embassy. Thus, I am currently attending online classes from Lagos, Nigeria with the hope of joining the class in Berlin by the 4th of January, 2021 at the latest.

Given my financial circumstances, I am being confronted by the stark reality of my hopes of studying at ESMT being dashed, my tuition scholarship going to waste and my life’s ambition not coming to fruition. Thus, the only way I can stand a chance of making it for my studies in time is through the assistance from well-meaning benefactors like yourself.

    My Ask </h6>
I would like to solicit for your support and assistance in every way possible to enable me to obtain the outstanding amount required to complete my living expenses for my visa application. I understand that current times are difficult, but it would really go a long way if you can help with any amount possible. I believe with the collective strength from each of your contributions, I would be a step closer to actualizing my ambition and this would place me in a position to impact the lives of others in any way that I can.
