            <h6 class="font-bold py-2"> Dear Patron, </h6>
            <h6 class="font-bold py-2"> Introduction </h6>
            

My full name is Blessing Olajumoke Farounbi. I graduated with a CGPA of 4.03/5 in Economics from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria in 2018, completed my Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) professional qualification in 2016 and passed the CFA level 1 examination in December 2018. I am a go-getter, very passionate about making the most of my professional career and making an impact everywhere I go.
In pursuit of my passion to add an international perspective to my knowledge in finance and investment and how technology can be applied to this sector, I applied to the European School of Management and Technology (ESMT), Berlin for a master’s in management degree, with a specialization in finance and investment. After a rigorous and highly competitive application process, I was granted admission to ESMT for the 2020/2021 session with a full tuition scholarship.

<h6 class="font-bold py-2"> Why ESMT Berlin </h6>

ESMT is the no 1. business school in Germany providing specialized courses in Management. My decision to pursue advanced studies at ESMT will not only set me to become an international thought leader in my chosen field, it would also increase my knowledge base and ability to proffer investment solutions in Africa from a global perspective. I am also very passionate about structuring financing options for small and medium enterprises in order to enable them to access the required funds for developing that innovative idea or achieve scale in their production process or service offerings.  

<h6 class="font-bold py-2"> My Predicament </h6>

My admission to ESMT Berlin was also attached to a full tuition scholarship based on my intellectual excellence as well as evidence of personal, academic and professional achievement. The full tuition scholarship granted by the ESMT covers my tuition and cases only. 

Due to Covid-19 and the closure of the German embassy in Lagos, ESMT had come up with an online Management Essential Program with other schools like IE, Spain and Imperial College, London to provide an online learning platform for students that were unable to make it to Campus in time for the earlier resumption date of 15th September. With this, I have been to complete my first semester of studies from Nigeria. 

Recently, I have been able to secure an appointment for a visa interview on the 18th January 2021 at the German embassy in Lagos. In order to process my visa successfully, I would need to have placed in a blocked account 10,500 Euros to cover my living expenses, out of this amount I have been able to raise 5,500 Euros (NGN3,025,000) from my personal savings and contributions from family and friends.  

In this vein, I would like to seek your assistance in raising the outstanding amount of 5000 Euros(NGN2,750,000) in order to process my visa by the embassy by the ending of January, 2021. Given my financial circumstances, I am being confronted by the stark reality of my hopes of studying at ESMT being dashed, my tuition scholarship going to waste and my life’s ambition not coming to fruition. Thus, the only way I can stand a chance of making it for my studies in time is through the assistance from well-meaning benefactors like yourself.

<h6 class="font-bold py-2"> 
    My Ask </h6>
I would like to solicit for your support and assistance in every way possible to enable me to obtain the outstanding amount required to complete my living expenses for my visa application. I understand that current times are difficult, but it would really go a long way if you can help with any amount possible. I believe with the collective strength from each of your contributions, I would be a step closer to actualizing my ambition and this would place me in a position to impact the lives of others in any way that I can.

<br></br>
If you are happy to offer your support in this time of need, please make your donations via the options below. I would be in contact to provide regular updates on the status of my fundraising and visa process to every donor. I would be delighted to hear from you via email or phone to provide any clarifications that you may require.

I thank you in advance for being a part of my story to make a difference as you help make this education a possibility for me.
